  <h1>FAQ</h1>

  <h3><u>"Why did I lose my locally saved notes?"</u></h3>
  <p>You may have cleared your browser cookies or local storage. The notepad uses those to store your notes.</p>

  <h3><u>"Why aren't the copy/paste tools working?"</u></h3>
  <p>You or your browser may have blocked the clipboard permission. Please set the permission to "allow" (You can find the permission in Google Chrome by clicking the lock to the left of the website address.).</p>
  <h3><u>"Am I safe if I put sensitive information here?"</u></h3>
  <p>Sensitive information is safe here. Your notes are only saved locally (to your browser), and the website won't store it on a server. HOWEVER, because of this, sensitive information can be lost. Do not save it soley here.</p>
  <h3><u>"It says that the last autosave is "null". What does this mean?"</u></h3>
  <p>That just appears if you haven't used the autosave feature before. Once you use it, a date will pop up.</p>
